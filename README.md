# Wenqi_Deng_Pokemon_Defense

Project Description:

This project is a 2D tower defense game with characters in Pokemon. In a randomly generated 2D map, players need to defeat different types of enemies entering map before they reach the end of path. After defeating all waves of procedurally harder enemies, players win. If any enemies reach the end of path, players lose.


How to run:

Instructions:
Players can determine total number of waves they are going to face in the game (not fewer than 5 or more than 20) at the starting page using arrow keys. They can view the rules of the game or start the game directly at this page.
Players gain points over time or by defeating enemies. They can purchase Pokemon once player’s points exceed their required points (and their required points will be deducted from total player’s points). Each Pokemon has different ways of attacking enemies and required points. Players can select Pokemon and place them on map using mouse and determine direction they face with arrow keys.
Players can pause or play the game after starting. Also, they can choose the speed level of enemy moving on the setting page.
After the game end, players can click restart to go back to the starting page.
